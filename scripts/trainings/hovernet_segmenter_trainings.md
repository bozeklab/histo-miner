# General

For now the training has to be done from submodules istself, not in the core code. Meaning user should use the python scripts inside:

```bash
/src/models/
```

In the future, after publication of the paper, if I receive several request I can prepare a bash training script for hovernet training and a bash training script for segmenter traning inside the core histo-miner code. It will put it in this directory:

```bash
/scripts/trainings/
```

For now,  you can read some advices and remarks for both trainings in following sections:
